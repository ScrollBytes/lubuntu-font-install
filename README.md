# lubuntu-font-install
Shell Script to quickly install fonts on Lubuntu.


First ...

1. Place "install-fonts.sh" in an empty folder.
2. Make it executable by opening terminal (CTRL+ALT+T) and typing "chmod +x /path/to/script/install-fonts.sh"

Then ...

1. Copy your zip folders with TTF or OTF fonts into same directory as "install-fonts.sh"
2. Open terminal and type "/path/to/script/install-fonts.sh" and hit Enter key to run script.
3. Fonts will be installed (moved to Lubuntu fonts directory)!


Replace "/path/to/script/" with the actual path on your computer. You can get the path by opening your file manager, right-click on "install-fonts.sh" and click "Copy path(s)".
